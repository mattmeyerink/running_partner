# Running Partner API
This is the API for the Running Partner Platform. Data is at the heart of any good distance training plan. This product has the goal of placing a runner's training plans and training journal in one place for future planning alongside past analysis.

The goal of this API specifically is to handle user's data from our Mobile and Web Frontend in the most efficient, secure way possible as our users are at the heart of what we do here! 

# The Technology
Currently our API is running on the Flask Framework of Python on a Heroku server.
